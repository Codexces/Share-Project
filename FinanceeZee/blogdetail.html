                            <h3>What Is Employee Performance?</h3>
                            <p>Employee performance can be defined as how well an employee fulfills his/her job responsibilities, completes tasks, and behaves with team members and other colleagues. When managers monitor an employee’s performance, they evaluate
                                it based on employee effectiveness, work quality, work quantity, and also the overall output efficiency.</p>
                            <p>Qualitative skills, such as communication skills and problem-solving capability are also used to measure employee performance.</p>
                            <h3>Why Is it Important to Improve Employee Performance?</h3>
                            <img src="images/blog-banner2.webp" alt="">
                            <p>Maximizing the employee performance can help an organization to accomplish goals in a most cost-effective and timely manner. The success of an organization depends mainly on the employee’s performance. And, when your employees
                                are productive and motivated, they can easily achieve the target on time.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, improving the employees’ performance will not just help in achieving goals but also improve their work satisfaction and decrease the staff turnover rate.</p>
                            <h3>How to Measure the Performance of Employees?</h3>
                            <img src="images/Employee-feedback-loop.webp" alt="">
                            <p>Before you start measuring your employee’s performance, it is important to define goals or metrics against which employees’ performance will be measured.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fix measurable OKRs (objectives and key results) and individual objectives</li>
                                <li>Conduct regular performance review of employees</li>
                                <li>Perform a skill gap analysis to identify the required skills</li>
                                <li>Gather qualitative feedback from customers and employees</li>
                                <li>Measure the percentage of tasks completed by employees within the stipulated time</li>
                                <li>Use a 9-grid box method to assess and evaluate employee’s performance</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>7 Ways to Boost Your Employees’ Performance</h3>
                            <img src="images/blog-banner3.webp" alt="">
                            <p>In your organization, you can implement different strategies that can help your employees feel supported and valued and enable them to perform better. Here are some strategies you can implement within your organization to improve
                                the employees’ performance.</p>
                            <h4>Establish an Effective Communication</h4>
                            <p>Ineffective communication can lead to confusion and disengagement among employees regarding their job responsibilities and projects they are working upon. Therefore, it is important for managers to communicate effectively with
                                employees regarding job responsibilities.</p>
                            <p>With proper communication, you can improve the coordination among employees, enhance organizational management, and also ensure that all the information related to a business project is communicated properly to employees. When
                                the work-related information is passed to employees properly, they will be able to complete the assigned task efficiently and on time.</p>
                            <h4>Identify and Resolve the Poor Performance Causes</h4>
                            <img src="images/Cause-of-poor-perfermance.webp" alt="">
                            <p>Identifying the causes of your employees’ poor performance is the first step towards improving their performance. The reasons could be high workload, lack of skills for the specific role or tasks, personal or financial problems,
                                etc. Once the reason is identified, you can quickly devise a plan to fix the problem that helps an employee to work better.</p>
                            <p><span>Example: </span> If an employee is facing problems in his/her personal life like marital issues, drug addiction, or a recent death in the family, the company can provide counselling sessions through their EAP programs.
                                These sessions can help employees feel better and suggest ways to overcome these issues and work with more concentration.</p>
                            <h4>Giving Rewards to Employees</h4>
                            <img src="images/blog-banner4.webp" alt="">
                            <p>Giving incentives and recognition to the employees’ contribution is one of the best strategies that can make employees perform better. If not appreciated properly, the employee can start looking for better jobs where his contribution
                                will be valued.</p>
                            <p>The recognition can be in the form of monetary rewards or non-monetary rewards like appreciation mail, handwritten cards, etc. Regular recognition of employees’ work can help in boosting their morale and motivating them to
                                work better.</p>
                            <p><span>Example: </span> An organization can pay their employees an extra amount for achieving the target on time along with a shopping voucher that can be redeemed on any e-commerce shopping site.</p>
                            <h4>Providing Proper Training</h4>
                            <img src="images/blog-banner5.webp" alt="">
                            <p>Proper job training for the required skills is important to retain your employees and increase profit margins. Well-trained employees can deliver the highest quality of work instead of employees who lack the required skills.</p>
                            <p>To train your employees, you can use training software through which you can provide training courses that the employees can take conveniently. Further, you can also provide on-site training by inviting training personnel to
                                your organization.</p>

                                            that time but Sir has his own knack of teaching stuff in such an interactive way that there was never a dull moment in the class. I’ll always remember sir as one of the sweetest and most proficient professors
