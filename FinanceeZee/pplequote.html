                                <p>Studying managerial accounting under the guidance of Sandeep Sir has been a game changer for me. The way I used to look at finance before and after taking his classes stand completely on different grounds. I first met Sir
                                    in the first term of my MBA at MDI, Gurgaon in 2022. Coming from a legal background and being in the field of law for almost a decade, studying finance was something I was apprehensive about. However, in Sandeep Sir’s
                                    teaching till the end of the course I used to wonder where did the hard part lie? Sir’s teaching methodology which involves blending of real-world examples with theoretical concepts, makes the learning process seamless.</p>
                                <p>With the practical insights and interactive teaching style through questions and answers, Sir effortlessly demystifies complex topics. In fact, I was prompted and motivated to delve deeper as I found interest in the subject
                                    subsequent to attending his classes. Lastly, and most importantly Sir is extremely receptive of opinions and is extremely approachable which enables learning beyond books and classrooms. I am truly grateful for getting
                                    the opportunity to be able to attend his classes and learning to look at a subject much dreaded with confidence and an inquisitive mind.

                                <p>Sandeep Sir took our introductory course on Finance called ‘Management Accounting -1’ during our first year of PGDM. I remember that I was way too anxious about this course because finance as a domain was a completely unchartered

                                <p>I have been a student of Prof. Sandeep Goel during my Term 3 at MDI, when he facilitated the course &quot;Corporate Finance&quot;. What I found quite interesting about his content and approach was that he was not hell-bent
                                    on how long (short, rather) the classes were; instead, it was always about how finance as a course can be made more approachable for students with any and all levels of expertise.</p>
                                <p>Having had a rather abysmal understanding of Management Accounting initially, I used to get repulsed by the mere idea of having to go through financial statements or annual reports or companies. But, Prof. Sandeep Goel
                                    made all those fundamental fears go away.</p>
                                <p>I wouldn&#39;t call myself an expert of Finance by any stretch. But, a teacher&#39;s main function, in my opinion, is to first make the fear and imposter syndrome of students go away. Once that is done, the student automatically
                                    becomes a curious learner. Prof. Sandeep did that exactly!</p>

                                    I gained from your teaching continues to be an asset in my daily work.</p>
                                <p>Moreover, your unwavering support and mentorship extended beyond the classroom. You were always approachable, taking the time to listen to your students and provide guidance. Your willingness to share your industry experiences

                                    I’ve been a teacher myself, I was simply mesmerized by his teaching style and etiquette in the classroom. What stood out more was his passion for the subject matter, and it instilled in me a deep curiosity to explore
                                    further. </p>
                                <p>During my transition to the PhD program, Prof. Sandeep seamlessly transitioned from being my professor to becoming my Research Guide. His guidance and mentorship have been invaluable as I navigated the challenges of conducting
                                    research and writing my thesis. He provided insightful feedback, encouraging me to think critically and pushing me to achieve my full potential. The unwavering support and belief in my abilities gave me the confidence
                                    to overcome obstacles and succeed in my academic pursuits. He not only has expertise in the field but also cares genuinely for his students&#39; well-being and success. At times he went above and beyond to create a
                                    nurturing and inclusive learning environment, fostering open discussions and encouraging diverse perspectives.</p>
                                <p>I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to learn from Prof. Sandeep. His mentorship has not only enhanced my knowledge and skills but also shaped my character and instilled in me a lifelong love for learning. I wholeheartedly
