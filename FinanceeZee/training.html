                                        <p>Sandeep Sir took our introductory course on Finance called Management Accounting 1 during our first year of PGDM. I remember that I was way too anxious about this course because finance as a domain was a completely

                                            that time but Sir has his own knack of teaching stuff in such an interactive way that there was never a dull moment in the class. I’ll always remember sir as one of the sweetest and most proficient professors
                                            at MDI who always aims for the collective learning of his entire class irrespective of their educational background or area of interest/domain.
